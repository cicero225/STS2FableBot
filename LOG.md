# Lab Notebook

*Newest first. One entry per live session / milestone (see PLAN.md §6).*

## 2026-06-11 — First live session: M0 plumbing verified

**Game:** v0.103.3, Steam release branch · **Mod:** STS2MCP 0.4.0 · **Bot profile:**
modded scope `profile1` (fresh; physically separate tree from owner's vanilla saves —
isolation confirmed on disk and via API).

Setup: mod installed via `scripts/install_mod.py` (game found at
`I:\SteamLibrary\...`), saves backed up twice via `scripts/backup_saves.py`
(owner's vanilla profile1 has an in-progress run; untouched). Owner enabled
"Load Mods" in-game (needs one manual restart the first time).

**Run 1** (halted by design): 8 decisions in, hit `monster` state with no `battle`
block — transitional room-loading state not in the API docs. C5 fail-loud worked.
Three doc-vs-live gaps found and fixed:
1. `battle` is briefly absent while a combat room loads → optional + policy waits.
2. `character_select` lingers after embark; re-confirming errors → confirm sent once.
3. `singleplayer` menu goes straight to character select (no standard/daily submenu).

**Run 2** (first complete run): trivial policy, Ironclad A0. Died floor 9, Act 1, to
ENCOUNTER.NIBBITS_NORMAL (per the game's own `.run` record). 159 decisions, ~5 min
wall clock (poll 0.5s, normal animation speed). Full decision log + SQLite row
written; game-over dismissed; loop returned to main menu cleanly. **M0 behavior
demonstrated end-to-end live.**

Discoveries:
- The game writes rich JSON run records to `saves/history/*.run` (win flag, seed,
  build_id, killed_by, per-floor history) — wired in as the authoritative outcome
  source; better than the API for post-run analysis later.
- The mod's `/api/v1/compendium` 404s on this build ("Not found") — not needed (the
  `.run` records + `/api/v1/profile` cover us), but noted upstream-issue-worthy.
- Fresh-profile FTUE: one tutorial prompt at run start, declined by the navigator.
- Throughput estimate at normal speed: ~2s/decision → a full (3-act?) run maybe
  20-40 min; speed control (P2 fork) will matter for the climb.

Open: double game-over dismiss (two `ok` menu_selects — harmless, tidy later);
victory=None on run 2 (fixed after the fact — enrichment from `.run` records now in,
verified by run 3).
