# Lab Notebook

*Newest first. One entry per live session / milestone (see PLAN.md §6).*

## 2026-06-11 (final) — Shakeout series done: 3 clean runs, 3 characters, all fixes tested

**Run 5** (Regent, resumed) stalled at a rewards screen: potion reward + full belt
no-ops with status "ok" forever; stall rail killed the run as designed. Fixed:
rewards policy abandons items after two claim attempts. **Run 6** (same Regent run
resumed) completed: died floor 11 Act 1 to ENCOUNTER.BYGONE_EFFIGY_ELITE, seed
MVPTHFRUWN — deepest run yet; exercised multi-card select overlay ("Choose 2 Common
Cards"), Regent star costs, Unknown map nodes.

**Session tally (modded profile, all A0, trivial policy):** 6 runs — 3 completed
clean (Ironclad fl.9 / Silent fl.5 / Regent fl.11), 3 errored (each found a real
bug/gap, each fixed with a regression test: transitional battle-less combat state,
epoch-reveal menu gate, full-belt reward no-op). Owner interventions: 1 epoch
reveal + 1 accidental dialogue click-through. Everything else autonomous.

**Next session:** C# mod fork (character-select commit fix is the gateway to M1
character control; ascension selector + speed control + master deck ride along),
then P1 knowledge base + real policies. Open owner decision: GitHub fork of STS2MCP
under owner's account vs vendoring into this repo.

**Run 3** stalled by design: after the profile's first death the game gates the main
menu behind a Timeline epoch reveal (NEOW_EPOCH) which the mod refuses to automate
(can corrupt unlock state). Bot now surfaces `MANUAL:` waits loudly and waits ~5 min.
Owner revealed; recurrence is per-epoch (meta milestones), front-loaded then rare.
Fork investigation item filed.

**Run 4** (first fully-instrumented run): completed; victory=False from the game's
.run record, seed K4AQ5JS9JD, build v0.103.3, killed_by ENCOUNTER.SLIMES_WEAK, floor
5. Start event ("Nutritious Oyster" = relic boon) handled by the generic event
policy. **M0 exit criterion met.**

**BUG (top fork priority): character select does not commit.** Requested IRONCLAD
(mod clicked it; confirm became enabled) but the run started as The Silent; a
double-select experiment then started The Regent — who had just been unlocked by the
Silent run, supporting the theory that embark commits the screen's *focused*
character (the "NEW!"-badged newest unlock when present) and the mod's
`NCharacterSelectButton.Select()` doesn't update the embark payload on v0.103.3.
Roster snapshot from run 4's logs: Ironclad+Silent unlocked at profile start;
Regent/Necrobinder/Defect locked. Until the fork lands, the bot records the *actual*
character truthfully (player block + .run record) and stats split accordingly.

**Owner intel on dialogue screens:** click-through dialogue appears (a) on a
character's first arrival at Neow, (b) at Ancients, (c) at run end reaching the
Architect. Unknown yet whether (a)/(c) present as `event.in_dialogue` (handled) or
as opaque `overlay` (manual). Watch on next occurrences; (c) matters for win-path
game-over detection.

## 2026-06-11 — First live session: M0 plumbing verified

**Game:** v0.103.3, Steam release branch · **Mod:** STS2MCP 0.4.0 · **Bot profile:**
modded scope `profile1` (fresh; physically separate tree from owner's vanilla saves —
isolation confirmed on disk and via API).

Setup: mod installed via `scripts/install_mod.py` (game found at
`I:\SteamLibrary\...`), saves backed up twice via `scripts/backup_saves.py`
(owner's vanilla profile1 has an in-progress run; untouched). Owner enabled
"Load Mods" in-game (needs one manual restart the first time).

**Run 1** (halted by design): 8 decisions in, hit `monster` state with no `battle`
block — transitional room-loading state not in the API docs. C5 fail-loud worked.
Three doc-vs-live gaps found and fixed:
1. `battle` is briefly absent while a combat room loads → optional + policy waits.
2. `character_select` lingers after embark; re-confirming errors → confirm sent once.
3. `singleplayer` menu goes straight to character select (no standard/daily submenu).

**Run 2** (first complete run): trivial policy, Ironclad A0. Died floor 9, Act 1, to
ENCOUNTER.NIBBITS_NORMAL (per the game's own `.run` record). 159 decisions, ~5 min
wall clock (poll 0.5s, normal animation speed). Full decision log + SQLite row
written; game-over dismissed; loop returned to main menu cleanly. **M0 behavior
demonstrated end-to-end live.**

Discoveries:
- The game writes rich JSON run records to `saves/history/*.run` (win flag, seed,
  build_id, killed_by, per-floor history) — wired in as the authoritative outcome
  source; better than the API for post-run analysis later.
- The mod's `/api/v1/compendium` 404s on this build ("Not found") — not needed (the
  `.run` records + `/api/v1/profile` cover us), but noted upstream-issue-worthy.
- Fresh-profile FTUE: one tutorial prompt at run start, declined by the navigator.
- Throughput estimate at normal speed: ~2s/decision → a full (3-act?) run maybe
  20-40 min; speed control (P2 fork) will matter for the climb.

Open: double game-over dismiss (two `ok` menu_selects — harmless, tidy later);
victory=None on run 2 (fixed after the fact — enrichment from `.run` records now in,
verified by run 3).
